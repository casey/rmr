extract the exact packet timing from the package dumps
continuously vary the framerate from 0 fps to 60 fps and see where it breaks

screen:
- perhaps the timing is very crucial, and needs to be exact
- why am i one+ frame behind?
- wtf is up with that weird jump?
- why does it sometimes render multiple frames at the same time?
- should i have two sockets, one for frames and one for nulls?
- try varying the PWM frequency divider
- try sending each packet twice or three times, with and without nulls
- figure out the lookup table/proper curve
- create a test video that flashes black and white
- better replay tools: name payloads, optional nulls
