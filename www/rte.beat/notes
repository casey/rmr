. start tapping beat
. guesses bpm and continues beat
. can correct beat if it drifts


effects:
- blur on high volume
- invert
- greyscale/color drain on high volume, color drain on low volume

signal types
- on/off
- beat

should i just use max?

- some way to construct the 1/1 1/2 1/3 1/4 interface on the fly
- source node
- how to reduce user error?
