next generation tech:
- c++ core
- functional scripting in haskell with all IO being handled by a custom monad
- dynamic scripting in javascript
- fast compilation by separation of components:
  - support modules
  - component based engine
  - haskell blobs implementing game logic
- runs both in the browser via native client and via a normal plugin

- find someone in the area to teach me controllerism/ableton, in exchange for programming lessons
- friends of the box mailinglist (djs, producers, musicians, etc) control who is allowed to join/post to the list
- weekly private jam session at culture box before it opens
- weekly maker/creative people meetup at the box- shaders

hanging strings of color


- 2d canvas
- divs

- layers - overdrawing - z division
- filters - modification
- panes - division of x/y division
  - can scale a pane while it resizes or can crop it
  - can keep proportions or can distort it
- x/y/z division, 3d boxes

- color schemes
- framework for doing low-resolution (40 x 80 -> 50 x 100) prototypes
- framework for multiplexing the screen into subscreens
- plan for the whole club

particle system
something with a 3d box that extends into the screen
something with voxels
really nice waveform, spectrogram, levels
single pulsing colors

modes
effect
styles

spend a lot of time watching DJs

replicate the dj from upstairs to downstairs


test the latency of native client. i'm sick to death of js. i can keep using it for scaffolding and rapid prototyping.

or really, maybe i should just keep going with js. fuck, who knows.

latency testing:
- js
- nacl
- native

input:
- audio
- messages

work:
- fft
- rendering

output:
- audio
- graphics
- messages

rows of shapes, illumination dot moving across them according to the intensity of that frequency. squares, triangles, or voronoi graphs

get a job doing something

Inventory everything in the club: network, computers, lights, power, etc
Plex
Full erosion, tunneling sim, lasts whole night, plants, worms, dwarves, surface dwellers
Color change over night, intensity, measure crowd, volume, participation
come up with a few color palettes with red as the main color
github.com/casey/box - cbox
plex, see it live in the browser
tap to split, preview touch screen, color schemes (red is "white")

if i have latency problems with js/webgl/native client, get in touch with the people on chrome who can help me fix them

some kind of subdivision of the screen into rectangular sections. allow recursive subdivision. each subdivision perfectly multiplexes its own resources. - optionally do something with borders

Need a way to measure latency and jitter:

water sim flowing outward, boxes a la dreamworks screensaver, gravity sim (maybe combine with liquid sim), game of life, smooth life, 2d life, very complex text/graphs/fake computer display (all possible data from host computer, fps, ram, cpu, procs, etc), some kind of notion of activity and time
